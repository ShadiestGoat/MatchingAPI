# Dating/Bullying API

## What is this project?

This is a RESTfull API for The Dating/Bullying project. The philosophy behind this project is that all these dating apps like tinder are using these advanced algorythms, but are only taking into account what people say about themselves. I mean I claim that I'm the hottest man around, doesn't mean it's actually true! Also, they generalise quite a lot. Most people can be into X, but I personally could not care less about X. Some of the algorythms/AIs don't get that. 

How do we solve that problem? Well, people are really attracted to certain traits of you, so why don't we break that down. Treat your traits as data points. Then, ask the end user about their opinions regarding these traits. How much do they care about it? What are their preferances? Etc. 

After we gain all that data: phase 2. This is where the potential bullying comes in. We make the user vote on other user's traits. How kind they are, how funny they are, etc. This way we don't get self proclaimed hottest men. 

Anyways, all in all, this is my plan for world domination

## When is this applicable?

Now, if we want the users to vote for each other, they should at least know each other. This is not a tinder alternative. Therefor, this works in large groups where everyone is more or less aware of each other. For example, a class of students. 

My best solution for this is to basically have groups that the user can join. Note, that the data is shared between groups. If user A is in group X and in group Y, then a user from group Y saying that user A is annoying would affect their scores in group X.

## This is great, where can I track the proccess?

Well this is the main reposotory. [My TODO list is here](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/YXnZjGMcSQBGu9D0)
